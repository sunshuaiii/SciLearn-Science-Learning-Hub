# How to start this assignment
1. `git clone _repo https link_` to clone code file
2. `git checkout -b _branchname_` to create a new branch
3. `npm install` in this project to install node module
4. Now you can start your work at your new branch!

# How to submit your code (pull request)
1. `git add .` to save all your code in your branch
2. `git commit -m "_message_"` to commit your code (remember to write what you modify or did in the message section to let us understand your code faster)
3. `git checkout master` + `git pull` switch to main branch and makesure your code is up to date with main branch (or also call master branch)
4. `git push` or `git push --set-upstream origin _your branch name_` and use the git push code to upstream
5. Go to your branch and create pull request by clicking the button show below. Write information about the pull request and click "Send pull request"

# Guideline
1. Only add / modify code in your section to avoid any error when we merge the file
2. Better to use `git commit -m "_message_"` to do commit. Add some message to say what changed you have done so everyone can easily track yyour code
3. Remember always `git pull` first before you do any changes to make sure your code is up to date

# Git command cheat sheet
1. `git clone _repo https link_` = clone this repo into your command line current folder (also called directory)
   git
2. `git status` = file you updated / created in git (red = not save, green = saved)
3. `git add . ` = save all you changes into git
4. `git add _filename_` = save the changes the file you mention into git
5. `git commit` = commit your change to git repository (repository depend which branch you at)
6. `git commit -m "_message_"`= commit all file with a message
7. `git commit -am "_message_"`= commit __modified file__ with a message
8. `git push` = push your code to repository (depend on which branch you at)
9. `git branch` = to check all branch you have
10. `git branch -d _branchname_` = delete the branch you selected
11. `git checkout _branchname_` =  switch to different branch
12. `git checkout -b _branchname_` = create a new branch
13. `git pull` = pull the latest code from repo to your local folder
14. `git diff` = check different between your local folder code and repo code
